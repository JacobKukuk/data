title: Town of Darrington
description: >-
  Darrington, a small mountain town in the foothills of the Cascade Mountains,
  stands where two rivers once joined in a valley between the Sauk and the
  Stillaguamish rivers, and between Gold Hill to the east and Whitehorse
  Mountain to the west. Shifting sand and river rock formed a portage surrounded
  by towering Douglas fir and cedar trees. Over time a community took root, a
  town grew, and a history formed.
